    "\n",
    "A time series data is a sequential set of data points, measured over successive time period (usually on equal intervals). \n",
    "It\n",
    "\n",
    "For example if we take measurements of heart rate, blood pressure (BP), sugar level every 5 minutes from an individual, it can be represented as time series data as shown below\n",
    "\n",
    "<table>\n",
    "    <tr><th> time </th><th> heart_rate </th><th> blood_pressure </th><th> blood_sugar_level </th></tr>\n",
    "    <tr><td> 01/01/2011 10:00:00  </td><td> 76 </td><td> 119/76 </td><td> HIGH </td></tr>\n",
    "    <tr><td> 01/01/2011 10:05:00 </td><td> 77 </td><td> 119/76 </td><td> HIGH</td></tr>\n",
    "    <tr><td> 01/01/2011 10:10:00 </td><td> 76 </td><td> 129/77 </td><td> LOW </td></tr>\n",
    "</table>\n",
    "\n",
    "we refer to variables heart_rate, blood_pressure, etc. as measurerands or sensors (sensor readings/measurements). \n",
    "\n",
    "A time series Data shown above it multivariate. if we consider only a single column (such as heart_rate) then we call it as univariate. \n",
    "\n",
    "A time series may consist of readings that can be continuous or categorical. A *continuous* means, it takes on any value from real $\\mathbb{R}$  \n",
    "some measurands may take on values from a fixed set of possible values - for ex: binary {0,1} that represents a status or state - we refer those measurands as *categorical*  \n",
    "\n",
    "From the example above, *heart rate* and *blood_pressure* can be viewed as continuos and blood sugar level is categorical; in the example it takes values from {HIGH, LOW}\n",
    "Usually time series dataset, the consecutive observations are recorded at equally spaced time intervals such as hourly, daily, weekly, monthly or yearly time\n",
    "separations. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A time series data analysis is to discover the insights. The time series data can be analysed using descriptive statistics; several inferences can be made on it. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples of Time series Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Time series appears more frequently than any other dataset and forms a very critical type of data analysis applicable to a large domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples include:\n",
    "\n",
    ">* Stock Market data \n",
    "* Daily airline passengers (many variations of these)\n",
    "* Monitoring data from survillance \n",
    "* etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many insights can be found using the time series data. Few examples are:\n",
    "\n",
    ">* Understand the descriptive statistics such as firt and second order statistical moments such as mean, mode, variance etc.\n",
    "* If a sensor exhibit trend, seasonaility, cyclical nature ( will be explained later)\n",
    "* If a sensor is stationary or show variability (explained later)\n",
    "* continuous or categorical\n",
    "* duratin when it is valid \n",
    "* if a pair of sensors are mutually related\n",
    "* if sensors represent action or status\n",
    "* Describe the logical model (or the underlying dynamic nature of the system)\n",
    "\n",
    "Several inferential statistics may consists of:\n",
    "\n",
    ">* if sensor hs interaction with other sensor and predict the strength of the interaction\n",
    "* apply predictions to predict one or more ahead \n",
    "* detect anomaly\n",
    "* Detect Novelty\n",
    "* Detect fault\n",
    "* predictive maintenance \n",
    "* Predict fault/failure \n",
    "* Detect usage and forecast reamining life\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Time series sensors can be described by its intended function, modalities, duration when it is active, valid range of operational values etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many algorthms that exists to analyze time series data; we will go through each in its own right in this book\n",
    "\n",
    "The most popular are:\n",
    "\n",
    ">* Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA). \n",
    "* ARIMAX \n",
    "* ARX \n",
    "* System Invariant Analysis Technoology (SIAT) based on ARX\n",
    "* Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) \n",
    "* Deep Neural Network based models:\n",
    "> LSM, CNN, Autoencoders, Feed Forward Networks (FNN), Time Lagged Neural Network (TLNN)\n",
    "* Hidden Markov Models\n",
    "* Markov Chains\n",
    "* Non linear ArCH models\n",

    "\n",
    "A time series may exhibit Trend, Cyclical, Seasonal and Irregular components. \n",
    "\n",
    "A *Trend* is tendendency of time series to increase (or decrease) in its measured values in some uniform way \n",
    "\n",
    "*Seasonality* is the carateristic of showing a pattern depending on the time - for ex: sale of ice cream on beach during summer is higher than in winter time.\n",
    "Seasonality could be important for marketing and sales planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *cyclical* nature is the pattern exhibited over many periods of time that helps to forecast or observe the historical events.\n"
